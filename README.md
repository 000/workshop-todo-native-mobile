# React Native Todo List + Astra DB + Netlify üìí
*40 minutes, Beginner/Intermediate*

In this workshop, you will learn how to convert the Todo web application from a previous [DataStaxDevs workshop](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/appdev-week1-todolist) into a React Native mobile and web application. We will actually be using the same database setup as before, so if you've already created it during the prior workshop, you can skip the Database setup section of this workshop.

This is an example React Native Todo application using a [DataStax AstraDB](https://dtsx.io/appdev-7-7) free tier database.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Frequently asked questions ‚ÑπÔ∏è 
- *Are there any prerequites?*
> * You will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
> * You will need to [download Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) on your mobile phone (if you wish to do that part)

- *What other prerequisites are there?*
> * You will also need an Astra DB account, but we'll work through that in the exercises
> * Use **Chrome** or **Firefox** for the best experience. Other browsers are great, but don't work well with the GitPod integration we use a bit later.

- *Can I run the workshop on my computer?*
> There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine.
> If you do so, you will need
> * git installed on your local system
> * [node 15 and npm 7 or later](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/blog/update-node-js/)
> * [Expo CLI, Watchman, Xcode, Android Studio, and an iPhone or Android](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
>
> You will have to adapt commands and paths based on your environment and install the dependencies by yourself. **We won't provide support** to keep on track with schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to be successful.

- *Do I need to pay for anything for this workshop?*
> * **No.** All tools and services we provide here are FREE.

- *Will I get a certificate if I attend this workshop?*

**Part 1: Create the Database**

## 1. Login or Register to AstraDB and create database
**`ASTRADB`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, $25.00 USD credit every month, roughly 5M writes, 30M reads, 40GB storage monthly - sufficient to run small production workloads.  

### ‚úÖ Step 1a: Click the button to login or register with Datastax. You can use your `Github`, `Google` accounts or register with an `email`.

_Make sure to chose a password with minimum 8 characters, containing upper and lowercase letters, at least one number and special character_

<a href="https://dtsx.io/appdev-7-7"><img src="https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-graphql-netflix/blob/main/img/create_astra_db.png?raw=true" /></a>
- <details><summary>Show me!</summary>
    <img src="https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-stargate/raw/main/images/tutorials/astra-create-db.gif?raw=true" />
</details>

**Use the following values when creating the database**
|Field| Value|
|---|---|
|**database name**| `todos_native_workshop_db` |
|**keypace**| `todos` |
|**Cloud Provider**| *Use the one you like, click a cloud provider logo,  pick an Area in the list and finally pick a region.* |

_You can technically use whatever you want and update the code to reflect the keyspace. This is really to get you on a happy path for the first run._

You will see your new database `pending` in the Dashboard.

![image](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-graphql-netflix/blob/main/tutorial/images/db-pending.png?raw=true)

The status will change to `Active` when the database is ready, this will only take 2-3 minutes. You will also receive an email when it is ready.

## 5. Check Node and NPM versions in GitPod
You will need node 15 and npm 7 or later.

```bash
npm -v
```

```bash
node -v
```

If either are not updated, run the following commands respectively.

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
nvm install node
```

## 6. Register for an Expo Account in GitPod

If you don't have an account:

```bash
expo register
```

If you already have an account:

```bash
expo login
```

Double check that you are logged in.

```bash
expo whoami 
```

## 7. Install Expo mobile application on your phone

Download the Expo App from the Android Play Store or iOS App Store.

## 8. Launch the Todo app

‚úÖ  **Step 8a:** Retrieve application token to securely connect to the database

Use the token you previously generated. If you no longer have the token and did not download a .csv, you can generate a new token using [the instructions above](#2-create-a-security-token)

‚úÖ  **Step 8b:** Configure Environment Variables and Install Dependencies

1. Set up your Astra Environment

In the repository directory run the following command  to set up your Astra environment.  Note that this does require Node 15 and NPM 7 to work.  You can install a node version manager like `nvm` or `n` to use multiple versions on your system.

```bash
npm exec astra-setup todos_native_workshop_db todos
```

- You will be asked to: **Please paste the Database Admin Token here** so copy over the Token you saved earlier.

‚úÖ  **Step 8c:** Add Host URL to .env

Get workspace URL:

```bash
bash hostURL.sh
```

Final output should look like the below:

‚úÖ  **Step 8e:** Start Netlify and Expo
  * Run the application (Ignore the QR code generated here)
 
  ```
  netlify dev ; gp preview $(gp url 8888)
  ```
  
  In a new terminal window: (or have a split terminal)
  
  ```
  expo start --tunnel
  ```
  
  Enter 'y' for yes when asked too use another port. Port 19000 is being used for the web app launched with netlify dev, that starts the web app with expo start --web (This opens when you start do netlify dev.)

## 10. Link to and Configure Netlify
Execute each of the commands below to link your code to your Netlify deployment.
  * First thing, we'll need to **STOP** the `netlify dev` command we issued a moment ago. In the terminal where you executed the netlify command issue a `CTRL-C` (control key + the C key) in order to stop the process.
  * Then continue with the following commands
  * This will pop up a browser to authenticate with netlify
  ```
  netlify login
  ```
  _Note, when using GitPod the preview pane will not display this properly. You must click the "open in a new window" button in the very top right of the preview pane._

  * This will link your workspace to the associated site
  ```
  netlify link
  ```

  * This will take the .env file created by astra-setup and upload it to netlify
  ```
  netlify env:import .env
  ```

<!--
  * Will be used to allow you to execute `netlify open`
  ```
  netlify sites:list
  ```
-->

### 11. Deploy to production
Now that you've hooked everything up, time to deploy to production.

  * Run
  ```
  netlify build
  ```

  * Then run
  ```
  netlify deploy --prod
  ```

  * Then finally run
  ```
  netlify open:site
  ```
  
  You've deployed your app to Netlify!
